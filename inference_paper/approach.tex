\section{Approach}

\subsection{Problem}
We want to predict the state of an user's phone based on the sensor data collected on the phone. 
From our observations and prior research, the most common states of the phone would be in a user's: backpack, pocket, hand, or on a table.
Upon a cursory observation of accelerometer traces, these phone states also appeared to be distinguishable and motivated
our approach to use deep learning to classify these states.
Sample accelerometer traces for the states, measured on a Nexus 5X
smartphone are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:AccelDiffStates}.

Our goal is to allow the classifier to predict phone states no matter what action the user may be performing.
This includes times when the phone is not physically on the user, including cases that may be very difficult to differentiate: a phone being in a still backpack versus on a table, for example.
Later, we propose a potential solution to this problem. 


\subsection{Features}
For creating features, the relevant sensor data were the accelerometer readings (X, Y, Z values), number of unlocks, number of screen touches, and number of times the screen turned on/off. 
For each window of 0.5s of these raw sensor readings, we generate the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Total number of phone unlocks}
\item \textit{Total number of phone touches}
\item \textit{Fraction of window that phone screen was on}
\item \textit{Mean acceleration in each of X, Y, Z}
\item \textit{Std. deviation of acceleration in each of X, Y, Z}
\item \textit{Mean magnitude of acceleration in each of X, Y, Z}
\item \textit{Std. deviation of magnitude of acceleration in each of X, Y, Z}
\item \textit{Phone is flat (handcrafted feature explained below)}
\end{enumerate}

The ``Phone is flat'' feature is a boolean feature derived from the raw accelerometer readings. 
The feature is 1 if the three equations below all hold, and 0 otherwise.
\begin{align*}
 \text{(Mean X Accel. Magnitude)} &< 1.0\\
\text{(Mean Y Accel. Magnitude)} &< 1.0\\
|9.8 - \text{(Mean Z Accel. Magnitude)}| &< 1.0
\end{align*}

Other sensors that we considered to be relevant for predicting phone states are the batched light sensor and step count.
However, the batched light sensor was not used because of its inability to distinguish outdoor nighttime darkness and the darkness from an enclosed backpack. 
We could not use the step count sensor because the sensor data we collected showed that this sensor was not reliable for our phones. 

We do not utilize a overlapping or `rolling' window.  Instead, we take distinct chunks of 0.5 seconds.
We believe that this is acceptable since the window size is small enough that we would not miss most transitions.
This decision is supported by previous work that found no notable difference in accuracy between using overlapping and non-overlapping windows \cite{Martin2013}.

\subsection{Architecture}
Our architecture has two parts.
The first consists of convolutional layers, while the second part contains dense fully connected layers.

\end{table}

In the convolution section, we use the raw acceleration data, which includes the acceleration in the x, y, z directions. 
After multiple one-dimensional convolution layers, max and global pooling, and dropout layers, 
we concatenate the 16 features above in order to incorporate the features that do not involve the data from the accelerometer.  
Together, these features are fed into the second part of the net.  
We chose to separate the features in this way in order to take advantage of the potentially periodic behavior of a user's acceleration in certain positions (e.g. walking).
The features that use the acceleration in the X, Y, Z are separated from the other binary features because we wanted to capture the time series data of the different phone states.
The other binary features are independent of the time, so these features are added in after the acceleration features go through the convolution layers.  

After the concatenation of inputs, our model has 6 dense layers culminating in 4 outputs, which match the four classes listed previously. 
Our model is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ConvNet} and a description is shown in Table ~\ref{tab:ArchDescription}.
We have experimented with other architecture, such as separate binary linear classifiers for each phone state and separate neural net classifiers for each phone state.
However, we found out this multiclass neural net classifier works best and has the highest accuracy rates. 
We also experimented with the number of convolutional and dense layers as well as the number of layer units and width of the convolutional filters.
