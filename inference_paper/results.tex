\section{Results}
\subsection{Single Phone Model}
Using the architecture detailed in, we trained the network for 10 epochs
and measured its effectiveness using $k$-fold cross-validation with $k = 10$.
Training/validation data was compiled from the four different diary studies
that used phone model WON.

To ensure that each fold had comparable training and validation distributions 
for each class, we preprocessed all of the diary study data before partitioning it
for cross-validation. Specifically, we divided the data of each diary study into its 
contiguous segments of each class (e.g. 10:00-11:15, Table or 13:55-14:30, Hand),
and then concatenated those segments together for each class. The result was four 
homogenous datasets, one of each class, such that for each fold, we could construct
the validation set by aggregating together $\frac{1}{k}$ of each class dataset and then
construct the training set by compiling the remaining $\frac{k - 1}{k}$ of each class dataset.
Within these homogenous class datasets, the data were not randomized but 
kept sequential.

The average accuracy across all folds was $92.06\%$, and the corresponding
confusion matrix is shown in Figure X.

\subsection{Multiple Phone Models}
We also attempted to validate our networks across different phone models, by training
on data collected by one phone model and then validating on data collected on a 
different phone model. We trained a network on all of the 
data collected from diary studies using phone model JOANNA, and then validated on 
two separate diary studies of data collected using phone model WON. In order to account
for inconsistent calibrations between the accelerometers of different phone models, we
recalibrated all accelerometer data...

However, results were inconclusive. On the first diary study with phone model WON, our network
had a validation accuracy of only $76\%$, but on the second diary study, our network had a validation
accuracy of $91\%$--an accuracy much more comparable to the cross validation accuracy
demonstrated in the single phone model case.
