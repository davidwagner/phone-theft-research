\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we apply deep learning to the task of determining the position of a 
user's smartphone on the user's person. We explore useful phone features that can 
be easily accessed from sensor data available to Android phone models, and also
identify four common phone positions that span most of a user's phone behavior
and appear distinguishable from the sensor data. We introduce a neural network architecture well suited
to process and learn from these features, and demonstrate that this architecture
can accurately classify a phone's position provided data from a single phone model. We also
propose an accelerometer calibration strategy for standardizing phone accelerometer
data across phone models, and show the potential generalization of a network trained on data from a single phone
model to other phone models. Lastly, we discuss the potential security application of this
network to phone authentication software.
